# Splitting Tip

iOS app developed following the IOS & Swift tutorial - the complete iOS-13 app development bootcamp on Udemy. In this module, I was challenged to create an application for dividing accounts and calculating tips. Based on the data the user needs to enter, such as bill amount, how many people will split and tip percentage, the app returns the amount people need to pay.
